Team Members : Patrick Marrin, Joey Bridges, Wesley Hanson, Corey Richard.

Project Overview:

Small toggle, either searching by what you want to make, 

or what you have in your kitchen to fill in a dish
using recipe API from Spoonacular, the search goes through an returns a few recipes (10?), with picture so you can see what the dish looks like. 

based on your original toggle, the webApp will connect to google maps API to show the nearest stores to you, either for the full list of ingredients or just for what you still need to get to make. 

small click boxes on the bottom of the page so we can filter out certain allergies, or food choices (vegan etc.)
